### Hi there üå§Ô∏è
*About Me*  
I'm a solar engineer in Southern California with a passion for new approaches to the design process. I've previously worked heavily on several energy simulation-based research projects as a mechanical engineering undergrad, in environments ranging from MATLAB to FORTRAN.  

*Experience*  
In the real world, I've developed interactive switch and sound interfaces, lighting FX controls, and process automation using Python on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and basic C tools.
My current focus is in automating the solar design process, starting with OCR in Python and exploring web dev tools.  

*Connect*  
I'm open to building new solar tech. This is definitely a field ripe for innovation with the application of new digital tools. Reach out if you have a cool project you're working on in solar and/or automation, or if you're interested in what I'm working on. Cheers!
