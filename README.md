### Hi there 🌤️
*About Me*  
I'm a solar engineer in Socal on a mission to radically optimize the residential solar and battery design process. I've previously worked on several energy-simulation research projects as a mechanical engineering undergrad, in coding environments ranging from C, MATLAB, Mathematica, Python, and FORTRAN. 

*Experience*  
In the real world, I worked in a prototyping & design startup, building interactive switch and sound interfaces and process automation in Python on Raspberry Pi, with lots of hand-soldered circuit components. I'm currently working with OCR in Python and web dev tools for interface design, exploring how to build impressive solar plans faster than ever.

*Connect*  
I'm open to building new tech together, this is definitely a place of opportunity with the application of new digital tools including ML and AI. Reach out if you have a project you're working on in solar design and/or automation, or if you have any questions about my work. Cheers!
