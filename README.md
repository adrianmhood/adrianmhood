### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
*About Me*

I'm a Solar Engineer in Southern California, blending my passion for renewable energy with my background in programming and technology. I also worked on simulation research projects as an undergraduate in mechanical engineering.

*Experience*

In previous roles I've developed interactive switch interfaces, lighting FX controls, and physical model simulations using Python on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and basic C.
My current focus is enhancing solar energy solutions through Machine Learning in Python and exploring web development fundamentals.

*Connect*
