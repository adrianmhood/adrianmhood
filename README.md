### Hi there üå§Ô∏è
*About Me*  
I'm a solar engineer in Southern California with a passion for new approaches to the design process. I've previously worked on several energy-simulation research projects as a mechanical engineering undergrad, in coding environments ranging from C, MATLAB, and FORTRAN. I'm exploring ways of building value in the solar and battery plan design process, giving engineers and homeowners the ability to build technically accurate and up-to-date plans faster than ever.

*Experience*  
In the real world, I've developed interactive switch and sound interfaces, lighting FX controls, and process automation using Python on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and basic C tools.
My current focus is in automating the solar design process, starting with basic OCR in Python, and basic web dev tools for interface design.  

*Connect*  
I'm open to building new solar tech together, this is definitely a place of opportunity with the application of new digital ML tools. Reach out if you have a project you're working on in solar design and/or automation, or if you have any questions about my work. Cheers!
