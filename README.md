### Hi there üå§Ô∏è
*About Me*

I'm a Solar Engineer in Southern California, building my passion for renewable energy with an engineering approach. I've previously worked heavily on several energy simulation-based research projects as a mechanical engineering undergrad, in environments ranging from MATLAB to FORTRAN.

*Experience*

In the real world, I've developed interactive switch and sound interfaces, lighting FX controls, and process automation using Python on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and basic C tools.
My current focus is in automating the solar design process through OCR in Python and exploring web dev tools.

*Connect*

I'm open to work on new solar tech! Reach out if you have a cool project you're working on.
