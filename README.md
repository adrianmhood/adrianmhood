### Hi there 🌤️
*About Me*

I'm a Solar Engineer in Southern California, blending my passion for renewable energy with my background in programming and tech. I've previously worked on several simulation research projects as a mechanical engineering undergrad.

*Experience*

In previous jobs I've developed interactive switch and sound interfaces, lighting FX controls, and process automation using Python on Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and basic C tools.
My current focus is enhancing solar energy solutions through Machine Learning in Python and exploring web development concepts.

*Connect*

I'm open to collaborate on new solar tech! Reach out if you have an interesting project you'd like some feedback or support with.
